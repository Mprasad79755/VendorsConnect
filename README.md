# Local Vendor-Customer Connection App

## Abstract

This mobile application is designed to bridge the gap between local vendors and customers in a user-friendly and efficient manner. The app caters to two distinct user groups: **vendors** and **customers**. Vendors can be categorized into two types:

1. **Fixed-location vendors** who operate from a specific location.
2. **Roaming vendors** who move around the city.

The primary goal of the application is to provide a digital platform where customers can discover and connect with local vendors offering fruits, vegetables, and other products, thereby promoting local businesses and improving accessibility.

## Features

- **Menu Upload and Management:** Vendors can upload and manage their product menus, providing details like prices and availability.
- **Order Tracking:** Vendors can track incoming orders and update their status.

### Customer Features
- **Customer Search and Discovery:** Customers can search for nearby vendors using location-based filters or browse through categories.
- **Order Placement:** Customers can choose to visit the vendorâ€™s location or place orders for home delivery (offered by roaming vendors).

- **Ratings and Reviews:** Customers can rate and review vendors to help others make informed choices.

### General Features
